#pragma mark - App group staging

// A private app's bundle and data container live in FlekDeck's own
// container, which LiveProcess cannot read, so both are staged into the app
// group before the guest starts and the container is brought back when it
// exits.
//
// Upstream LiveContainer hands LiveProcess security-scoped bookmarks to the
// private files instead, and on iOS 26.4 those stopped opening for most private
// apps (upstream issue #1265). The "Open Private Apps in Windows Without
// Copying" developer switch goes back to bookmarks, to test whether they work
// on a given build and iOS version.
//
// Staged files go under LiveContainer/Staging/<this FlekDeck's URL scheme>,
// never beside the shared apps. A copy in LiveContainer/Applications is
// indistinguishable from a shared app: one left behind by a FlekDeck killed with
// a window open appeared on the home screen as a second, shared copy of the app,
// which could be neither deleted nor converted. A folder per FlekDeck also keeps
// two of them that run the same app from staging over each other's copy, and
// keeps the shared apps' own Tweaks folder out of it.
//
// This used to be remove-then-copy run inline on the main thread. Both halves
// scale with the number of files rather than their size, so an app with a large
// asset tree froze the UI for seconds at each end — which is why big games and
// media-heavy apps felt so much worse to open and close than small ones, and
// why the window animation stuttered. Measured on a 20k-file tree: a recursive
// remove is ~610ms and NSFileManager's copy ~1660ms, against ~140ms to clone
// the tree and ~0.1ms to rename it.
//
// So nothing here removes or copies a tree on the path the user is waiting on:
// trees are cloned into place, displaced by a rename, and deleted later.
//
// The helpers that clone, discard and settle the copies are in LCSharedUtils.m,
// where a single-mode launch, which never loads this file, can reach them.

// Serial: two windows opening at once would otherwise race on the same staged
// bundle, and each stage is short enough that serialising them costs nothing.
